# Event_Management

The project featured a multi-role login system with four types of users: student, admin, club member, and club head. Club members could create events, which then required approval from the club head. Once approved, the event details were sent to the admin for verification. After verification, the event booking process was completed.

Students could register for events and make payments using Razorpay integration. The platform also provided a comprehensive calendar view where users could click on dates to see a list of events scheduled for that day.
